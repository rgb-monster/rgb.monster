RGB Monster has been proudly presenting shows at Adelaide Fringe <mark class="subtle">since 2019</mark>, and we're excited to be presenting a wonderful roster of international talent at this year's festival. Ollie Horn brings back his award-winning [Kids Can Heckle](/kids-can-heckle?festival=Adelaide+2025), our family-friendly comedy club [PG Hits](/pg-hits?festival=Adelaide+2025) returns to offer big laughs for all the family, and our laugh-a-minute [5 Headliners for $25](/headliners?festival=Adelaide+2025) continues to offer unbeatable value. We love being in SA, and we hope you find something you love!
