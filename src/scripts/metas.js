On tonight's improvised show, our guest, Matt Davis, is here to promote his latest project: whatever you decide! And here's our hosts, sharing the spotlight and audience suggestions, attempting to keep their show on the air and deliver the best interview for their bizarrely niche viewership. Ladies and gentlemen, please give it up for interactive lunacy, featuring comedians from across the Fringe. *Applause*",
